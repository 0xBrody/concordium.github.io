Concordium is a privacy-focused, public and permissionless blockchain architecture, with a range of novel features that allow individuals, businesses and public institutions to use permissionless blockchain technology in a way that is private, trusted, scalable and compliant with regulations.

The Concordium Platform is designed to be fast, secure and cost-effective. Concordium’s innovative identity layer provides on-chain identity compliance-centric payments and enhanced privacy for users, while also allowing for the de-anonymization of network participants.

Concordium’s two-layer consensus protocol consists of a Nakamoto-style consensus blockchain and a finality layer for fast confirmation of transactions. The sharding design enables high transaction throughput and private shards for business use cases and sensitive data. Concordium also enables interoperability and communication between shards and between Concordium and other blockchains.

Concordium has a standards-based smart contract core with multi-language support. The Concordium Platform also features a transparent incentive structure with cost-effective transactions and predictable fees.
